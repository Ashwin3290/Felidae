#Introduction
This is the model I made for Felidae dataset on kaggle using Tensorflow.
The dataset contains 243 images of 5 big cats namely Tiger,Lion,Cheetah,Leopard and Puma.

#Steps to run
Check out the dataset on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/juliencalenge/felidae-tiger-lion-cheetah-leopard-puma)

U dont have to download the dataset,Just open the felidae.ipynb using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) and run the program.
The code will download the dataset by itself.
It is recomended to use GPU in session resource so that the model trains faster.
GPU can be enable by following these steps:
*Click on the RAM/Disk usage, this will show real time graphs of RAM and Disk usage
*Then go to change runtime type
*For hardware accelarator select GPU and save
